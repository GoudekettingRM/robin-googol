        <h2>What is a Googol?</h2>
        <p>
          Basically, a Googol is a very, very, very (I can't emphasise this
          enough), very large number. It is 10<sup>100</sup>. Writing it out is
          already a pain, but here it goes:
          <blockquote>
            10,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000,​000
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          That wasn't so hard. It is just a 10 followed by 100 zeros. Actually it's nothing more than that, but there is a bunch of interesting information to be found on the

        <h2>Why would you make this??</h2>
        <p>
          This is a simple case of Robin found something interesting but wanted to know more and experience it better. A Googol is difficult to comprehend, because it's such a ridiculously large number. So I figured, why not try to scroll to the end*. And how better to do it than to put my own name on the screen a bunch, a Googol amount of times to be precise.

          <sub>* Spoiler: I did not make it till the end, maybe you can do better than I did </sub>
